# Digital Repertoire - The Field Notebook Portfolio

A modern, highly interactive personal portfolio designed around a physical "field notebook" aesthetic. Built with Vite, Vanilla CSS, and GSAP (ScrollTrigger), this site features a scroll-bound serpentine binding line that connects content cards dynamically as you scroll.

## 📖 Design Concept & Theme

The portfolio is styled as a **field notebook**:
- **Kraft Paper Texture**: Warm, natural background (`#EAE3D2`) overlaid with a subtle coordinate grid pattern.
- **Hand-Drawn SVG Accents**: Scattered custom SVG icons, including a typewriter/desktop scene, typewriter steam, terminal windows, coffee mugs, and hand-drawn stars.
- **Alternating Layout**: Asymmetric content cards that float left and right down the page.
- **Spine Line**: A custom-generated timeline that mimics a notebook spiral binding thread, dynamically drawing itself and connecting to sections as they enter the viewport.

## ✨ Features & Micro-Animations

- **Scroll-Synchronized Serpentine Spine**: A custom SVG Bezier curve path that stretches the full height of the document and draws itself to match the viewport's bottom edge.
- **Pop-in Connection Nodes**: Spine nodes (dots) bounce into view using GSAP's `back` ease exactly when the timeline reaches them, drawing dashed connection paths to the section cards.
- **Journey Timeline Connection & Sparkle**: The timeline curves swoopingly to connect directly with the Experience section's internal timeline, capped with a rotating sparkle animation.
- **Hover & Tilt Interactions**: Interactive elements tilt, wiggle, or rotate slightly on scroll and hover to give the notebook a tactile, responsive feel.
- **Responsive Layout**: Designed to collapse into a clean, legible mobile column, with the heavy timeline spine automatically hidden on small screens for optimal performance.
